                            <p> I watched it quite a long time ago on Netflix and the thing that really stuck to me was the dog scene in the very beginning, as it seemed odd that they would use real footage of that instead of something. Okay I lied, I watched almost everything that John C. Reilly has been in. The only things I didn't see were credits that were on his IMDB page but that I couldn't find a trace of on the internet, so either they never finished production or were only shown a limited number of times (e.g. Two Bits, Piggie, and an episode of Cracking Up). Below are my thoughts on his movies that stood out to me, especially those that he isn't known for as well. Check It Out! amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Casualt. EDIT: \ Will someone please volunteer to help me expand this list with contact names and resources before (and if) it gets sidebarred? In addition to Reddit perhaps we can put this elsewhere - not sure where but maybe start with a wordpress page or something. There is so much more out there and this just scratches the surface. If I waited to complete this by myself it wouldn't be done for a while which is why I posted. Please DM me to help me in doing something nice for our community. Unless you are running a system prior to 2000, you shouldn't have any problem running these. (Sorry to those of you still on a Tandy 386.) --- #1 Creatures 3/Exodus https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Creatures_3_%28Cover%29.png/220px-Creatures_3_%28Cover%29.png What is it? A life simulator, imagine the sims but 2D and with creatures called Norns on a spaceship. They will die of old age eventually but it is YOUR job to teach them. The ship has many dangers Not sure if this will necessarily fit in the context of this sub, but I still hope you'll find this list purposeful and interesting. In reflection of my subjective experience I consider these films "True Detective-like" because of their; mysterious, dreamlike, hazy and suspenseful atmosphere. Maybe this post will help you go through suffering of waiting another TD episodes. The Long Goodbye (Robert Altman, 1973) Inherent Vice (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2014) L.A. Confidential (Curtis Hanson. (This is a very long post so thank you, if you’re willing to spend the next few minutes reading this). This was originally posted in r/NFL but those mods removed it. Posting here. For someone who has accomplished exactly what he was traded for: to win multiple championships and be among the all-time Giants' franchise’s greatest players, Eli Manning gets a lot of heat and unfair criticism from the media and from other fanbases when I will argue that it is mostly entirely undeserved. Maybe. copied from forbes site, google yourself for original article It’s October 2018 and 2,000 video game fanatics are jammed into Austin’s Long Center for the Performing Arts to get a glimpse of Star Citizen, the sprawling online multiplayer game being made by legendary designer Chris Roberts. Most of the people here helped to pay for the game’s development—on average, 0 each, although some backers have given thousands. An epic sci-fi fantasy, Star Citizen was supposed to be finished in 2014. 
https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0817225/ Since you’re doing the 2007 list I think you should check this one out. It’s by Lee Chang-dong (director of Burning) and it’s the only Korean film in the criterion collection as far as I know. I think it’s pretty fantastic and it has two stellar performances. Hope you and everyone else here enjoys. I think Christopher Nolan (and his wife / producing partner) are very conscious of how well their films age from a set design, costume, and prop perspective. Take Inception. I think Inception will continue to age very well. It is nearly 10 years old, but still would pass for present day / the near future for a long time. All of the set design is sleek and takes place in trains, airplanes, modern hotels. The film benefits quite a bit from being able to incorporate classic, luxury settings. Link to phase 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/bieyha/2000s_mcu/?utm_medium=android_appamputm_source=share The purpose of phase 2 will be to conclude the solo X-Men, Spider-Man, and F4 films and bring in the Avengers. X-Men 3 (2007) After the events of Defenders, the team is heartbroken after all the collateral damage. Cable, a time traveler, comes to the X-Men to warn them about a being known as Apocalypse. His four horsemen include newcomers Deadpool and Gambit, Colossus. 
I've never posted on this sub before, so do excuse me if I ramble somewhat. I wanted to shift attention from "The Long Night" back to GRRM's books. The following is an essay I wrote for a school project about the historical comparisons between (a) Margaret of Anjou and Cersei Lannister and (b) King Edward IV and Robert Baratheon, which might make good material for discussion. Please feel free to comment on any other interesting comparisons between ASOIAF and history that you know of! amp#x200. I genuinely think iMDB top 250 is pretty good list (minus IMO Bollywood movies there that are way different than others and voted mainly just by Indian people and it doesn't appeal to much people that aren't from that part of the world and again some Nolan films and simlar being overrated but still), and I constantly see people here bash it and similar. But just look at current top rated movies for this updated r/movies top 250 lol. gt The Dark Knight (2008), Christopher Nolan Hello, you don't know me and probably never really will. Luckily, like any other day, I don't matter right now. What does matter is Sunshine, which I believe should matter a lot. Sunshine is a 2007 sci-fi movie by Danny Boyle - the same guy who made 28 days later. It's set in the near future and follows the crew of a spaceship called the Icarus-2, heading to the Sun to re-ignite it, because it's dying, and thus bringing on the extinction of the human race. They plan on re-igniting it by using. The year is 1998. Marvel, having sold film rights to many of their characters in the early 90s, were frustrated that no films had yet arrived. Most of these deals were 7 years old, and were going to expire soon. FOX was approaching them for renewal of the deal. (https://web.archive.org/web/20180626082737/https://variety.com/1999/film/news/marvel-fox-pact-for-pix-1117491127/) Meanwhile, SONY was about to sue, claiming that they still had rights to Spider-Man (https://web.archive.org/web/201. Warning Long Post The 2007 film Sunshine is one of my favorite movies and it is sadly divisive for a few reasons. None of which include the films interesting tension filled first 2 acts, stand out score by John Murphy, or stellar performances by the cast. No nearly all the divisiveness comes from the film 3rd act twist. The film admittedly goes from a atmospheric space thriller to nearly a Slasher film in a short time. However for me this twist completely works based on 2 things; Mark Strong's. 
Here are some things I often confuse. I'm hoping that writing them down will help them stick (though I doubt it). amp#x200B; Anyone want to share some things that often confuse them? amp#x200B; All information below is available at: ( amp#x200B; 🔆 Thomas Becket (1119-1170) - Archbishop of Canterbury under Henry II. There was a dispute because Henry wanted to extend his authority over the Church. So - I've just got back David Lynch's Someone Is In My House exhibition at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht and I must implore you all to go. It is possibly the most impactful exhibition that i've been to in about 8 years, and I'm someone who goes to a lot of exhibitions. It also offers huge insights into much of the mystery that we have been debating in the Return and across Lynch's other works. First of all - it is beyond expansive - including painting, sculpture, lamps and film.

We all have probably thought at one time or another if Ubisoft would remaster ACI at some point. Considering they already released a "Remastered" (more of an enhanced port) of AC Rogue, it's the only one left that hasn't gotten ported to 8th gen consoles. The closest we have is the Xbox One backwards compatible version, with a 4K enhancement patch on the X. What could we want or expect after getting the previous remasters of the other games for an ACI remaster. I'm sure people There are so many examples of Susan contradicting herself that it is hard to pick just one. But, her ~~supporters~~ enablers may want to just stop here and look at the evidence presented just here. Just this one thing. Ignore the 'haters' and just look at this one thing objectively, and ask yourself "WHY?"
